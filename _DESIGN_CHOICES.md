*- self: outline why the various files and settings where used to setup the flow. include only things that are out of the normal process.*

*- get building working locally, then work on getting it building on github workers*
*- ejection of expo to be able to build locally without relying on expo cloud*
*- why macos-12 instead of macos-latest (which would of been 11 according github docs)*

*-used bundle id: com.nicolasgomez.is27submissionsampleapp*
